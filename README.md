### SNHU - Full Stack Development

#### Architecture

**Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).**

In this project, I used Express HTML, as well as developed a single-page application with Angular. Both Express and Angular use JavaScript and are used for developing full stack applications. However, they both have their advantages, such as Express being much faster to develop with. However, developing a SPA with Angular allows a webpage to handle its resources more efficiently, such as only reloading the relevant data on a webpage instead of having to constantly update the entire contents of said page. 
  
**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**

MongoDB works great with a variety of other developing tools common in MEAN developemnt, and also uses JavaScript like Express and Angular. MongoDB and NoSQL databases in general scale well, which makes it an excellent choice for a scalable full-stack application. 

#### Functionality

**How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?**

JSON is used to organize data structures and objects, while Javascript can be used to define variables, objects, and functions. JSON can be used to create front end templates, and JavaScript can be used to program the functionality of the interactable contents on the page. 

**Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**

As previously mentioned, JSON can be used to create frontend templates. The static HTML code for the Travlr Getaway application was altered to utilize JSON templates to improve the speed that data is sent to the client side. 

#### Testing

**Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**

Having middleware that utilizes methods to block unauthorized users is crucial in developing a secure application.  API endpoints are used for an application to request services from other applications. 

#### Reflection

**How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**

I now have a better understanding of developing more complex fullstack applications that are appropriate for business use than I have prior to staring this course. I have learned how to better connect frontend and backend aspects of software beyond just creating a UI. Before this course I never knew about developing with Express or Angular, and made previous fullstack projects utilizing Python libraries such as Plotly or Matplotlib, and HTML code. I have a better understanding on how different fullstack development methods can fit specific scenarios, such as different use cases for Singe Page Applications vs Multi Page Applications.
